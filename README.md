## Project Objectives

1. Design an IP addressing scheme using subnetting.
2. Configure and manage dynamic/static routing protocols (OSPF and BGP).
3. Implement essential network services: Web, Email, DNS, DHCP.
4. Set up wireless LAN with robust security.
5. Develop and simulate interconnectivity between three autonomous systems (AS).

## Autonomous Systems Overview

### AS100: Faculty of Engineering and Technology Network
This network includes the departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science (CS). Key features:
- **IP Addressing**: Subnets optimized for servers, ECE, CS, and backbone connections.
- **Core Services**: Web, Email, DNS, and DHCP servers.
- **Routing**: OSPF configured for internal routing with multiple areas.

### AS200: Home-ISP Network
Represents a residential ISP network. Key features:
- **Wireless Network**: Configured with WPA2 security and AES encryption.
- **Dynamic NAT with PAT**: Translates private home addresses to public IPs.
- **Routing**: OSPF for intra-AS and BGP for inter-AS communication.

### AS300: Google Network
Serves as a simulated enterprise network with key DNS and Email services. Key features:
- **DNS Server**: Resolves domain names such as `gmail.com` and `it.birzeit.edu`.
- **Email Server**: Configured for SMTP and POP3 protocols with user accounts.
- **Routing**: OSPF for intra-AS and BGP for inter-AS communication.
